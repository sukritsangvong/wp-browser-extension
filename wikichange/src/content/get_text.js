Pasta (US: /ˈpɑːstə/, UK: /ˈpæstə/; Italian pronunciation: [ˈpasta]) is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.[1][2]

Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.[3] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.

Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names.[4] In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.[5]

As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven.[6] Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.[7]

In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.

Etymology

First attested in English in 1874, the word pasta comes from Italian pasta, in turn from Latin pasta, latinisation of the Greek παστά, pasta, 'barley porridge'.

History
Making pasta; illustration from the 15th century edition of Tacuinum Sanitatis, a Latin translation of the Arabic work Taqwīm al-sihha by Ibn Butlan[8]

In the 1st century AD writings of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried dough[9] and were an everyday foodstuff.[10] Writing in the 2nd century, Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil.[10] An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day lasagna.[10] However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to the modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.[10] The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.[11]

Historians have noted several lexical milestones relevant to pasta, none of which changes these basic characteristics. For example, the works of the 2nd century AD Greek physician Galen mention itrion, homogeneous compounds made of flour and water.[12] The Jerusalem Talmud records that itrium, a kind of boiled dough,[12] was common in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD.[13] A dictionary compiled by the 9th century Arab physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali[14] defines itriyya, the Arabic cognate, as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking. The geographical text of Muhammad al-Idrisi, compiled for the Norman King of Sicily Roger II in 1154 mentions itriyya manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily:

West of Termini there is a delightful settlement called Trabia [along the Sicilian coast east of Palermo]. Its ever-flowing streams propel a number of mills. Here there are huge buildings in the countryside where they make vast quantities of itriyya which is exported everywhere: to Calabria, to Muslim and Christian countries. Very many shiploads are sent.[15]

One form of itriyya with a long history is laganum (plural lagana), which in Latin refers to a thin sheet of dough,[10] and gave rise to the Italian lasagna.

History of manufacturing

At the beginning of the 17th century, Naples had rudimentary machines for producing pasta, later establishing the kneading machine and press, making pasta manufacturing cost-effective.[23] In 1740, a license for the first pasta factory was issued in Venice.[23] During the 1800s, water mills and stone grinders were used to separate semolina from the bran, initiating expansion of the pasta market.[23] In 1859, Joseph Topits (1824−1876) founded Hungary's first pasta factory, in the city of Pest, which worked with steam machines; it was one of the first pasta factories in Central Europe.[24] By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany was an established pasta manufacturer.[25] During the early 1900s, artificial drying and extrusion processes enabled greater variety of pasta preparation and larger volumes for export, beginning a period called "The Industry of Pasta".[23][26] In 1884, the Zátka Brothers's plant in Boršov nad Vltavou was founded, making it Bohemia's first pasta factory.[27]

In [[North Africa]], a food similar to pasta, known as [[couscous]], has been eaten for centuries. However, it lacks the distinguishing malleable nature of pasta, couscous being more akin to droplets of dough. At first, dry pasta was a luxury item in Italy because of high labor costs; durum wheat semolina had to be kneaded for a long time.

There is a legend of [[Marco Polo]] importing pasta from [[China]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174114/http://www.ilovepasta.org/faqs.html "Who "invented" pasta?"]. [[National Pasta Association]]: "The story that it was Marco Polo who imported noodles to Italy and thereby gave birth to the country's pasta culture is the most pervasive myth in the history of Italian food." ([[#Dickie|Dickie]], page 48).</ref> which originated with the ''[[Macaroni Journal]]'', published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting pasta in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pages=}} [[Rustichello da Pisa]] writes in his ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'' that Marco Polo described a food similar to "lagana". [[Jeffrey Steingarten]] asserts that [[Arab people|Arabs]] introduced pasta in the [[Emirate of Sicily]] in the ninth century, mentioning also that traces of pasta have been found in ancient Greece and that [[Jane Grigson]] believed the Marco Polo story to have originated in the 1920s or 1930s in an advertisement for a Canadian spaghetti company.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Steingarten|title=The Man Who Ate Everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T33d0IIwwaQC|year=1998|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-375-70202-0|page=260}}</ref>

Food historians estimate that the dish probably took hold in Italy as a result of extensive Mediterranean trading in the Middle Ages. From the 13th century, references to pasta dishes—macaroni, ravioli, gnocchi, vermicelli—crop up with increasing frequency across the Italian peninsula.<ref name="nationalgeographic">{{cite magazine |last1=López |first1=Alfonso |title=The Twisted History of Pasta |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2016/07-08/daily-life-pasta-italy-neapolitan-diet/ |access-date=18 December 2019 |magazine=National Geographic |date=8 July 2016}}</ref> In the 14th-century writer Boccaccio's collection of earthy tales, ''[[The Decameron]]'', he recounts a mouthwatering fantasy concerning a mountain of Parmesan cheese down which pasta chefs roll macaroni and ravioli to gluttons waiting below.<ref name="nationalgeographic"/>

Although [[Tomato#History|tomatoes]] were introduced to Italy in the 16th century and incorporated in Italian cuisine in the 17th century, description of the first Italian tomato sauces dates from the late 18th century: the first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook {{lang|it|L'Apicio Moderno}} by [[Rome|Roman]] [[chef]] [[Francesco Leonardi (Chef)|Francesco Leonardi]].<ref>{{cite book

The art of pasta making and the devotion to the food as a whole has evolved since pasta was first conceptualized. In 2008, it was estimated that Italians ate over {{cvt|60|lb|kg|order=flip}} of pasta per person, per year, easily beating Americans, who ate about {{cvt|20|lb|kg|0|order=flip}} per person.<ref name="lifeinitaly.com">{{cite web|last=Demetri|first=Justin|title=History of Pasta|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/food/pasta-history.asp|access-date=29 March 2012|archive-date=23 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190531/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/food/pasta-history.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref> Pasta is so beloved in Italy that individual consumption exceeds the average production of wheat of the country; thus, Italy frequently imports wheat for pasta making. In contemporary society, pasta is ubiquitous and there is a variety of types in local supermarkets, in many countries. With the worldwide demand for this staple food, pasta is now largely mass-produced in factories and only a tiny proportion is crafted by hand.<ref name="lifeinitaly.com"/>

[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11385 Pasta made from durum wheat.jpg|thumb|Pasta made from [[durum]] wheat]]
Since at least the time of [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s {{lang|la|[[De Agri Cultura]]}}, basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or [[semolina]],<ref name="Zanini" /> with [[durum wheat]] used predominantly in the South of Italy and [[soft wheat]] in the North. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice, and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours.
